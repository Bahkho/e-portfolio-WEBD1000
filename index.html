      <p>
        I'm a frontend developer with 1+ years of experience. Using my design
        skills, I create beautiful user interfaces for web applications, and I
        also write tests and debug code to ensure quality. Additionally, I
        develop analytical and functional web applications using my problem-
        solving skills and industrial experience.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I am also known as Bahkho. I am a student at NSCC (Nova Scotia
          Community College) currently studying software development. I focus
          more on frontend development because it was the first field I started
          with. I got into coding during COVID 19 pandemic when I downloaded
          Mimo app. Moving further, i learnt HTML and CSS, researched roadmaps,
          and watched online tutorials. My parents discovered my interest in
          computer science and then enrolled me at NSCC. Aside coding, i like to
          play games and watch movies.
