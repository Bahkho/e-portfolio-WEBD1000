      <p>My name is Abdul, i am a Frontend Developer</p>
      <p>
        I'm a frontend developer with 1+ years of experience. Using my design
        skills, I create beautiful user interfaces for web applications, and I
        also write tests and debug code to ensure quality. Additionally, I
        develop analytical and functional web applications using my problem-
        solving skills and industrial experience.

    <h1>About page</h1>
    <p>
      I am also known as Bahkho. I am a student at NSCC (Nova Scotia Community
      College) currently studying software development. I focus more on frontend
      development because it was the first field I started with. I got into
      coding during COVID 19 pandemic when I downloaded Mimo app. Moving
      further, i learnt HTML and CSS, researched roadmaps, and watched online
      tutorials. My parents discovered my interest in computer science and then
      enrolled me at NSCC. Aside coding, i like to play games and watch movies.
