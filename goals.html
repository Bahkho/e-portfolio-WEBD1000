      <p>
        As an IT programming student in Canada and aspiring frontend developer
        from Nigeria, here are five short-term goals (2 years) i am considering:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <u>Building a strong portfolio</u>: Spend time building various frontend
          projects such as websites, web applications, or mobile apps that
          showcase your skills as a frontend developer. These projects will
          serve as evidence of your competence and be helpful when applying for
          jobs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <u>Networking</u>: Attend technology conferences, workshops, or meetups and
          connect with professionals in your field. This can help you learn
          about the latest trends and technologies, and potentially land job
          opportunities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <u>Developing proficiency in relevant programming languages</u>: As a frontend
          developer, you will need to be proficient in languages such as HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Angular. Set a goal to
          improve your skills in these areas through online courses, books, and
          practice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <u>Internship</u>: Try to secure an internship with a reputable company in
          Canada. This will provide you with valuable work experience, expose
          you to different work environments, and potentially lead to a
          full-time job after graduation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <u>Working on soft skills</u>: Soft skills such as communication, time
          management, and teamwork are essential in any profession, including
          IT. Practice and improve these skills by collaborating with classmates
          on group projects or participating in extracurricular activities.
        </li>
      </ol>
